1. Functions
2. It causes the contents of the iostream file to be substituted

3. It makes definitions in the std namespace available to a program.
4. `std::cout << "Hello world" << std::endl;`
5. `int cheeses;`
6. `cheeses = 32;`
7. `cin >> cheeses;`

	second prototype:
	- name: rattle
	- output type: void
	- input type: int 
	third prototype:
	- name: prune
	- output type: int
	- input type: void
10. When you function is of type void.
11. You have not included the iostream header file,
	the solution will be to add `#include <iostream>`
